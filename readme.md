## QA Automation

This project is well-suited for performing automation testing using various QA frameworks. Here’s a brief overview of how it can be done:

1. **Selenium**:
   - Use Selenium to automate functional tests for the city search feature.
   - Create scripts to validate that the search results update correctly in real-time and that the UI responds properly to user interactions.

2. **Cypress**:
   - Cypress allows for end-to-end testing to verify the application’s behavior in different user scenarios.
   - Ensure that the application functions as expected by performing regression tests to confirm that new updates do not introduce bugs.

3. **Playwright**:
   - Playwright can be used for UI testing by simulating user interaction with the application across different browsers.
   - Verify the correct functioning of the responsive design and the display of application elements under various conditions.

## Dependencies
